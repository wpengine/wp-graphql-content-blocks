### Major Changes

- 7251fb0: Fix: use `use_block_editor_for_post_type` instead of `post_type_supports` when filtering the post types.
  **BREAKING**: Potential schema changes on previously exposed blocks that do not support the block editor. Those blocks will no longer inherit the `editorBlocks` field.

= 1.2.1 =

### Patch Changes

- 54affda: Adds mediaDetails field in CoreImage block:

  ```graphql
  {
    posts {
      nodes {
        editorBlocks {
          ... on CoreImage {
            mediaDetails {
              file
              sizes {
                name
                fileSize
                height
                width
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

= 1.2.0 =

### Minor Changes

- a118662: Added new `wpgraphql_content_blocks_should_apply_post_type_editor_blocks_interfaces` filter to allow controlling whether ${PostType}EditorBlock interfaces should be applied.

### Patch Changes

- 2e7f2e8: Refactored `register_block_types` to remove usages of `register_graphql_interfaces_to_types` to improve performance.

  Deprecated `Anchor::register_to_block` public static method.
