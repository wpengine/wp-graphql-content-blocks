### Minor Changes

- 6241c4e: fix: prevent fatal errors by improving type-safety and returning early when parsing HTML.
  The following methods have been deprecated for their stricter-typed counterparts:
  - `DOMHelpers::parseAttribute()` => `::parse_attribute()`
  - `DOMHelpers::parseFirstNodeAttribute()` => `::parse_first_node_attribute()`
  - `DOMHelpers::parseHTML()` => `::parse_html()`
  - `DOMHelpers::getElementsFromHTML()` => `::get_elements_from_html()`
  - `DOMHelpers::parseText()` => `::parse_text()`
  - `DOMHelpers::findNodes()`=> `::find_nodes()`

### Patch Changes

### Major Changes

- ed23a32: MAJOR: Update Schema to reflect latest WordPress 6.5 changes.

  - WHAT the breaking change is: Added new `rich-text` type
  - WHY the change was made: WordPress 6.5 replaced some of the attribute types from string to `rich-text` causing breaking changes to the existing block fields.
  - HOW a consumer should update their code: If users need to use WordPress >= 6.5 they need to update this plugin to the latest version and update their graphql schemas.
