# WPGraphQL Content Blocks

## 3.1.1

### Patch Changes

- bc32b94: No functional changes between 3.1.0 and 3.1.1. This was tagged due to pipeline issues during the 3.1.0 release.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9fab724: Added support for automatic updates hosted from WP Engine infrastructure. Includes warnings when major versions with potential breaking changes are released.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- f15f95c: Adds missing default value for content attribute CoreParagraph and CoreCode blocks. This will make the type of the content field `String!` instead of `String`
- 9b71411: Feature: Add support for querying array type query data from blocks

  Query source block attribute types are supported. See: https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-attributes/#query-source

### Patch Changes

- be7a34f: Interface Types are now registered with the Post Type's `graphql_single_name`, instead of the Post Type's `name`. Fixes a bug where invalid Types were registered.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 7251fb0: Fix: use `use_block_editor_for_post_type` instead of `post_type_supports` when filtering the post types.

**BREAKING**: Potential schema changes for GraphQL Types representing a Post Type that does not use the Block Editor. Each GraphQL Type representing a Post Type that does not have block editor support previously would have had the `editorBlocks` field but that field will no longer exist on those Types.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 54affda: Adds mediaDetails field in CoreImage block:

  ```graphql
  {
    posts {
      nodes {
        editorBlocks {
          ... on CoreImage {
            mediaDetails {
              file
              sizes {
                name
                fileSize
                height
                width
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## 1.2.0
